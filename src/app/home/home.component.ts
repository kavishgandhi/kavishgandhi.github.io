    summary: 'The very first project that I was tasked with. We had to develop a MultiClass-MultiLabel Classification model which would help in classifying customers into different classes and categories. Depending on the classification the client would then send a personalized email to the customer. Since the number of data points was ~1MN, we decided to use PySpark for fast and distributed processing, and we were able to get ~3% more accuracy than the model built by our seniors'},
    {title: 'Report Generation Script', keywords: 'PySpark-Automation', 
    summary: 'One of the most challenging and the longest project. We were tasked with converting and scaling "R" Report Generation code into some other framework that could handle almost 9x the data and with that save time & effort. Knowing the capabilities of PySpark, we decide to go with that. The data was a combination of e-commerce sites across the world where the client had their products listed in 9 different markets spanning ~30 languages, we had to maintain the data integrity while processing (which "R" could not handle well). An entire service was developed which the client team could use and generate the report in one go rather than running the "R" code on their local system. The service developed was able to save ~9 hours of work and the number of people required to complete the task came down from 4 to 1'},
    {title: 'Retail Product Classification', keywords: 'ML-CV', 
    summary: "The next exciting project that I worked on was that of developing a pilot to detect client-specific retail products from the e-commerce websites' banners. For this task, we tried and were not successful in using the off-the-shelf classification models, since the products were kinda specific to the client. Hence, we researched different models available to use and decided to implement MILDNet, which looked promising. And voila! We had developed a model which could match the products from the banners to the catalog with top-5 accuracy of 87%"},
    {title: 'Naive user can now train their own ML Models', keywords: 'ML-FastAPI-Automation', 
    summary: 'Since we were the R&D team, many client-facing teams would come to us with a request to build a custom ML model for prediction. And to do this every time a dataset changed would be a waste of development time. So, we decided to build a service using which a naive user can train their ML model (without any ML background) with their custom dataset. This was proven to be successful since it saved ~1200 hours of manual work per month'},

    summary: 'One of the always ongoing task(s) that I was assigned was automating the manual work done by other team members using Python. This essentially helped save a lot of work for various client delivery teams'}
